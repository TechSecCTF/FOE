==== pwntools ====
pwntools is an exploit development framework written in python. It consists of
several modules, each of which makes a given task much easier. We'll be using
the pwnlib.tubes and pwnlib.util modules heavily in this class.

* pwnlib.tubes.process
This module is used to communicate with programs. It contains the process
object, which allows us to programmatically interface with running processes.
Useful functions include:

** send                  - sends data
** sendline              - like send, but appends a newline before sending
** read / recv           - receive data
** readline / recvline}  - receive data until a newline is found and return it
** readuntil / recvuntil - receive data until the specified string is found, and
                           return it
** readregex / recvregex - receive data until the specified regex is matched,
                           then return it
** interactive           - interact with the process directly

>>> p = process("cat")
>>> p.send("hello")
>>> p.read()
'hello'
>>> p.sendline("goodbye")
>>> p.readuntil("by")
'goodby'
>>> p.readline()
'e\n'
>>> p.shutdown()
>>> p = process(["echo", "test", "string"]) 
>>> p.readregex(".*str")
'test str'
>>> p.readline()
'ing\n'

* pwnlib.util
This module provides several convenient functions for manipulating data. Here
are a few of the most popular ones:

** enhex - convert an ASCII string to hexadecimal
** unhex - convert a hexadecimal string to ASCII
** p64   - pack an integer into a 64-bit machine word
** u64   - unpack a 64-bit machine word into an integer

>>> s = "pwntools is awesome"
>>> s_hex = enhex(s)
>>> s_hex
'70776e746f6f6c7320697320617765736f6d65'
>>> unhex(s_hex) == s
True
>>>
>>> val = 0xffffdeadbeefffff
>>> data = p64(val)
>>> data
'\xff\xff\xef\xbe\xad\xde\xff\xff'
>>> val == u64(data)
True

==== pwndbg ====
pwndbg is an extension to gdb to make exploitation easier. Once installed, it
runs automatically when gdb is started. Some of the most useful pwndbg commands
are:

context [registers / disassembly / stack / backtrace] - display
        information on the program state
emulate / nearpc [address] - view disassembly near address (or near
        the program counter by default)
stack - display the stack and resolve pointers it contains
db    - display data as bytes
dw    - display data as words
dd    - display data as double words
dq    - display data as quad words
ds    - display data as strings
dps   - resolve pointers
bp    - set breakpoint
bl    - list breakpoints
bd    - disable breakpoint
be    - enable breakpoint
bc    - clear breakpoint

Walk through the execution of example_elf again, this time going over each
of the above commands while doing so.

==== Memory Corruption ====
Since local buffers and local variables are both stored on the stack, they are
near each other in memory. This can cause problems if too much data is written
to a buffer, as the excess data will be written to any variables beneath it (at
a higher address). This concept is best understood with an example.

** memory_corruption
Look at the source and disassembly for memory_corruption.c
Send inputs of size 64 and 65 on the command line (pipes + alt)
Analyze the 65 byte input in gdb, mentioning how endianness affects the view
Overwrite the token to call win() from gdb
Call win() with a script
Call win() from the command line

** ret_overwrite
View the source, show that memory_corruption exploit fails, and see why
    (order of variables switched)
Send gradually longer inputs, including length 80 and 79
Analyze length 80 input in gdb, view clobbered return address (before + after)
Call win() from within gdb
Call win() from a script
call win() from the command line
Use readelf --symbols to call other functions from the command line
It's possible to chain multiple calls. Can you tell why?

We can use shellcode to execute arbitrary instructions, rather than just the
instructions in the program. The idea is to include machine code to spawn a
shell, or shellcode, in our input, then overwrite the return address with the
location of the shellcode. We can't determine the shellcode's location exactly
however, so we will add a nop sled and guess several offsets. If the return
address points anywhere in our nop sled, the shellcode will be executed.

+----------------+
|                |
|                |
|    nop sled    |<---+
|                |    |
|                |    |
+----------------+    |
|                |    |
|   shellcode    |    |
|                |    |
+----------------+    |
| return address |----+
+----------------+

We can get machine code directly from pwntools, and the approximate buffer
address from gdb.

>>> from pwn import *
>>> context.arch = "amd64"
>>> shellcode = shellcraft.sh()

    /* execve(path='/bin///sh', argv=['sh'], envp=0) */

    push 0x1010101 ^ 0x6873
    xor dword ptr [rsp], 0x1010101
    xor esi, esi /* 0 */
    push rsi /* null terminate */
    push 8
    pop rsi
    add rsi, rsp
    push rsi /* 'sh\x00' */
    mov rsi, rsp
    xor edx, edx /* 0 */
    /* call execve() */
    push SYS_execve /* 0x3b */
    pop rax
    syscall
